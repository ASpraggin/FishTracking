	abstract = {Skip to Next Section Colonization of novel habitats often results in the evolution of diverse behaviors. Comparisons between individuals from closely related populations that have evolved divergent behaviors in different environments can be used to investigate behavioral evolution. However, until recently, functionally connecting genotypes to behavioral phenotypes in these evolutionarily relevant organisms has been difficult. The development of gene editing tools will facilitate functional genetic analysis of genotype-phenotype connections in virtually any organism, and has the potential to significantly transform the field of behavioral genetics when applied to ecologically and evolutionarily relevant organisms. The blind cavefish Astyanax mexicanus provides a remarkable example of evolution associated with colonization of a novel habitat. These fish consist of a single species that includes sighted surface fish that inhabit the rivers of Mexico and southern Texas and at least 29 populations of blind cavefish from the Sierra Del Abra and Sierra de Guatemala regions of Northeast Mexico. Although eye loss and albinism have been studied extensively in A. mexicanus, derived behavioral traits including sleep loss, alterations in foraging and reduction in social behaviors are now also being investigated in this species to understand the genetic and neural basis of behavioral evolution. Astyanax mexicanus has emerged as a powerful model system for genotype-phenotype mapping because surface and cavefish are interfertile. Further, the molecular basis of repeated trait evolution can be examined in this species, as multiple cave populations have independently evolved the same traits. A sequenced genome and the implementation of gene editing in A. mexicanus provides a platform for gene discovery and identification of the contributions of naturally occurring variation to behaviors. This review describes the current knowledge of behavioral evolution in A. mexicanus with an emphasis on the molecular and genetic underpinnings of evolved behaviors. Multiple avenues of new research that can be pursued using gene editing tools are identified, and how these will enhance our understanding of behavioral evolution is discussed.},

	abstract = {{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Abstract{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Fish display a remarkable diversity of social behaviors, from highly social to largely solitary. While social behaviors are likely critical for survival, surprisingly little is known about how they evolve in response to changing environmental pressures. With its highly social surface form and multiple populations of a largely asocial, blind, cave-dwelling form, the Mexican tetra, \textit{Astyanax mexicanus}, provides a powerful model to study the evolution of social behavior. Given numerous morphological and behavioral differences between the surface and cave forms, a primary impediment to understanding how this behavior evolved is a lack of computational and statistical approaches that can precisely identify independent aspects of social behavior. Here, we use motion tracking and kinematic analysis to quantify social swimming patterns and argue that the absence of schooling in cavefish is not merely a consequence of their inability to see but rather a genuine behavioral adaptation that impacts the way they explore their cave environment. Surface fish school, maintaining both close proximity and alignment with each other. In the dark, surface fish no longer school, but we show that they still attempt to align and maintain proximity when they find themselves near another fish. Conversely, cavefish exhibit little preference for proximity or alignment, instead actively avoiding each other. Cavefish also slow down when more fish are present in the tank, which neither surface fish in the light or in the dark do. Using data-driven computer simulations, we show that those two traits – active avoidance and collective slowdown – are sufficient to shift the exploration strategy of cavefish from mostly-following-the-walls to exploring-the-entire-tank. Finally, we find that those differences in collective swimming patterns are largely consistent across independently-evolved cave populations, revealing an evolutionary convergence on this emergent social behavior.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Author Summary{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}The Mexican tetra fish offers a fascinating window into the evolution of schooling behavior. Its ancestral-like surface form is found in the rivers and lakes of Mexico and Texas and is highly social. Over the last million years, \textit{A. mexicanus} repeatedly evolved a second, largely asocial cave form after colonizing a series of dark, underground caves. Here we use motion tracking technology to compare the collective displacement patterns of four populations and present evidence that the loss of schooling in cave populations (i) is a genuine example of parallel behavioral evolution rather than a mere consequence of not being able to see in the dark and (ii) could constitute a cave-specific exploration strategy.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
